    "text": "The 187th ESGI will be held on 14-18 July 2025 at the University of Bristol.\n\nAbout the ESGI\nThe European Study Group with Industry (ESGI) is a five-day intense workshop that brings together mathematical scientists and partners from business, industry, and government. Partners present a pressing problem they are currently facing, and mathematical scientists work on finding a solution. ESGIs are internationally recognised as a cost-effective means of making real progress on current challenges in just a few days.\n\n\nESGI Format\nESGI 187 will follow the tried-and-tested format:\n\nOn the first day of the workshop, each organisation presents their challenges.\nThe mathematical scientists then split into groups, and for the next three days work closely with each external partner representative to brainstorm ideas, model scenarios, and problem solve.\nOn the final day, each group presents their progress and recommended routes forward.\nAfter the meeting, appropriate deliverables from the week will be made available to the organisation; traditionally this has been a technical report summarising the week’s work. Examples of past reports can be found in the MIIR repository.\nIn principle, there are no limits to the problems that can be tackled by mathematical modelling! We are expecting over 70 mathematical scientists from across the UK and Europe to participate in our workshop with expertise in, for example, statistical modelling, fluid and solid mechanics, heat and mass transport, data science, and machine learning."

    "text": "The University of Bristol is dedicated to creating a welcoming, inclusive, and safe environment for all participants, including staff, students, and visitors. We are committed to a conference free from harassment, where everyone is treated with respect, dignity, and courtesy. Our community thrives on cooperation and mutual respect, and we expect all participants to contribute to maintaining these standards.\n\nUnacceptable Behaviours\nThe following behaviours are considered harassment and are unacceptable within our conference setting:\n\nDiscriminatory Comments: Making offensive or belittling comments related to age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, physical appearance, sexual orientation, socio-economic status, religion, or other personal characteristics.\nInappropriate Language: Using language that is inappropriate or offensive. This includes remarks that may not be directly aimed at an individual but create a hostile environment.\nIntimidation and Bullying: Engaging in threats, stalking, or other forms of intimidation.\nUnauthorized Recording: Taking photographs or recording activities without the explicit consent of the individuals being recorded, mainly when it serves to harass or intimidate.\nInappropriate Physical Contact: Engaging in unwanted or unsolicited physical contact.\nUnwelcome Sexual Attention: Making unwelcome sexual advances, comments, or gestures.\n\n\n\nReporting and Enforcement\n\nImmediate Action: If you witness or experience conduct that violates our code of conduct, please do not hesitate to intervene if you feel safe doing so or promptly report the behaviour.\nContact Information: Concerns\nResponsibility and Accountability: The School of Mathematics will take any reports seriously. All reports will be investigated promptly and thoroughly, and appropriate action will be taken. If you provide your details, then we will discuss with you different options to deal with the incident to ensure that it is dealt with in a manner that suits you.\n\n\n\nCommitment to Improvement\nWe continually seek to improve our policies and practices to ensure they meet the high standards of inclusivity and safety we set for our community. Feedback on the Code of Conduct is welcomed and can be sent to the conference organizers."

    "text": "If you think that your organisation might have something to gain from discussing a problem with us, do not hesitate to contact the ESGI organisers. We will be more than happy to arrange an online meeting, without any need for an immediate commitment, for an initial discussion about formulating such a problem. The confidentiality of the data provided is assured.\nAlmost all industrial problems have some mathematical aspect to them, although the mathematics is not always recognisable at first. Indeed, from our own experience, some of the most successful study group problems were not well-defined in mathematical terminology at the start of the study group. Study group problems can come from a wide range of industrial areas, such as engineering, electronics, transport, agriculture, energy, finance, and medicine. For more information on past study groups, including a description of some of the problems which have been presented at previous meetings, see the project descriptions from last year’s UK ESGI.\nCompany representatives may be present only on the first day (to expose their problems) and on the last day (for the results), but they may also stay the entire week to brainstorm ideas.\nAfter the event, a report on each problem will be sent to the company. Say more about a visit after funded by KE Hub??\nFor information on how to submit a problem, please contact the organisers."
