The University of Bristol is dedicated to creating a welcoming, inclusive, and safe environment for all participants, including staff, students, and visitors. We are committed to a conference free from harassment, where everyone is treated with respect, dignity, and courtesy. Our community thrives on cooperation and mutual respect, and we expect all participants to contribute to maintaining these standards.


# Unacceptable Behaviours

The following behaviours are considered harassment and are unacceptable within our conference setting:

* Discriminatory Comments: Making offensive or belittling comments related to age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, physical appearance, sexual orientation, socio-economic status, religion, or other personal characteristics.

* Inappropriate Language: Using language that is inappropriate or offensive. This includes remarks that may not be directly aimed at an individual but create a hostile environment.

* Intimidation and Bullying: Engaging in threats, stalking, or other forms of intimidation.

* Unauthorized Recording: Taking photographs or recording activities without the explicit consent of the individuals being recorded, mainly when it serves to harass or intimidate.

* Inappropriate Physical Contact: Engaging in unwanted or unsolicited physical contact.

# Reporting and Enforcement

* Immediate Action: If you witness or experience conduct that violates our code of conduct, please do not hesitate to intervene if you feel safe doing so or promptly report the behaviour.

* Contact Information: Concerns 

* Responsibility and Accountability: The School of Mathematics will take any reports seriously. All reports will be investigated promptly and thoroughly, and appropriate action will be taken. If you provide your details, then we will discuss with you different options to deal with the incident to ensure that it is dealt with in a manner that suits you. 

# Commitment to Improvement

We continually seek to improve our policies and practices to ensure they meet the high standards of inclusivity and safety we set for our community. Feedback on the Code of Conduct is welcomed and can be sent to the conference organizers.
