If you think that your organisation might have something to gain from discussing a problem with us, do not hesitate to contact the ESGI organisers. We will be more than happy to arrange an online meeting, without any need for an immediate commitment, for an initial discussion about formulating such a problem. The confidentiality of the data provided is assured.

Almost all industrial problems have some mathematical aspect to them, although the mathematics is not always recognisable at first. Indeed, from our own experience, some of the most successful study group problems were not well-defined in mathematical terminology at the start of the study group. Study group problems can come from a wide range of industrial areas, such as engineering, electronics, transport, agriculture, energy, finance, and medicine. For more information on past study groups, including a description of some of the problems which have been presented at previous meetings, see the [project descriptions](https://sites.google.com/view/180esgi/problem-descriptions) from last year's UK ESGI.

Company representatives may be present only on the first day (to expose their problems) and on the last day (for the results), but they may also stay the entire week to brainstorm ideas.

After the event, a report on each problem will be sent to the company. **Say more about a visit after funded by KE Hub??**

For information on how to submit a problem, please [contact the organisers](contact.qmd).
