Registration for ESGI 187 is now open!  There are separation registration
processes for academic staff and PhD students.

## Registration for academic staff

If you are an academic staff member
(post-doc, research fellow, lecturer or above), then please register using the
[ESGI 187 registration form for academics](https://forms.office.com/e/ichD6JiNCv).
The early-bird registration deadline is 1 May.

## Application process for PhD students

There are a limited number of funded places for PhD students
to attend ESGI 187.
Students with a funded place will be
provided with a room in [university accommodation](participants.qmd)
free of charge.  Funded places will be awarded on a competitive
basis or through a demonstration of need.

To apply for a funded place, please complete
the [ESGI 187 application form for PhD students](https://forms.office.com/e/tXiYh8iJra).
The first round of applications will close on 1 May.
Outcomes are expected to be announced by June.

If you are a PhD student at Bristol or you do not
require accommodation, please use the application form anyway.
