Funded places will be awarded on a competitive basis or through a demonstration of need.\nTo apply for a funded place, please complete the ESGI 187 application form for PhD students. The first round of applications will close on 1 May. Outcomes are expected to be announced by June.\nIf you are a PhD student at Bristol or you do not require accommodation, please use the application form anyway."

    "text": "The 187th ESGI will be held on 14-18 July 2025 at the University of Bristol.\n\n\n\n\n\nBristol’s Clifton Campus with Cabot Tower in the background\n\n\n\nAbout the ESGI\nThe European Study Group with Industry (ESGI) is a five-day workshop that brings together mathematical and data scientists and partners from business, industry, and government. Partners present a pressing problem they are currently facing, and mathematical and data scientists work on finding a solution. ESGIs are internationally recognised as a cost-effective means of making real progress on current challenges in just a few days. Several ESGI events are held throughout Europe as a core activity of the European Consortium for Mathematics in Industry.\n\n\nESGI Format\nESGI 187 will follow the tried-and-tested format:\n\nOn the first day of the workshop, each organisation presents their challenges.\nThe mathematical and data scientists then split into groups and, for the next three days, intensely work on idea brainstorming, model building, and problem solving.\nOn the final day, each group presents their progress and recommended routes forward.\nAfter the meeting, appropriate deliverables from the week will be made available to the organisation; traditionally this has been a technical report summarising the week’s work. Examples of past reports can be found in the MIIR repository.\nIn principle, there are no limits to the problems that can be tackled! We are expecting over 70 mathematical and data scientists from across the UK and Europe to participate in our workshop. Their expertise often spans statistical modelling, data science, fluid and solid mechanics, heat and mass transport, and machine learning.\n\n\n\nSponsors\nWe gratefully acknowledge support from:"

The event organisers will arrange a time for an online meeting with you shortly after to discuss problem ideas or provide more information about the event.\nAlmost all real-world problems have some mathematical or data modelling aspect to them, although this may not be recognisable at first. Indeed, from our own experience, some of the most successful study group problems were not well-defined in technical terminology at the start of the study group. Study group problems can come from a wide range of areas, such as engineering, electronics, transport, agriculture, energy, finance, and medicine. For more information on past study groups, including a description of some of the problems which have been presented at previous meetings, see the project descriptions from last year’s UK ESGI.\nCompany representatives may be present only on the first day (to expose their problems) and on the last day (for the results), but they may also stay the entire week to brainstorm ideas and provide feedback.\nAfter the event, a report on each problem will be sent to the company. Funding may be available for the group to visit your organisation after the event to discuss follow-up work.\nThere is a fee for presenting a problem at ESGI 187. For more information about fees or for general inquires about presenting a problem or the event, please contact the organisers."
